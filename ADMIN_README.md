# Admin Dashboard Documentation

## Overview

The Admin Dashboard provides comprehensive tools for managing the workspace matching platform. It includes features for reviewing applications, managing the matching queue, analytics, and system configuration.

## Access

### Admin Account Creation

1. **Via Database**: Admin accounts can be created directly in the database with role = 'admin'
2. **Via Admin Signup**: Visit `/admin/signup` with the admin secret key

**Default Admin Secret**: `ADMIN_SECRET_2024` (change in production)

## Technical Implementation

### Database Access

Admin users have elevated database permissions through Row Level Security (RLS) policies:

```sql
-- Admins can view all applications
CREATE POLICY "Admins can view all applications" ON applications FOR
SELECT USING (
    EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'
    )
);
```

### Route Protection

Admin routes are protected by middleware that checks:
1. User authentication status
2. Admin role verification
3. Automatic redirect for unauthorized access

### Data Security

- All admin actions are logged
- Sensitive operations require confirmation
- Role-based access control throughout
- Secure session management

## Usage Guidelines

### Daily Operations

1. **Morning Review:**
   - Check dashboard for overnight applications
   - Review high-score alerts
   - Process pending applications

2. **Application Processing:**
   - Use matching queue for systematic review
   - Apply consistent evaluation criteria
   - Document decisions with notes

3. **Communication:**
   - Use email templates for consistency
   - Personalize messages when appropriate
   - Track communication history

### Best Practices

- **Scoring Consistency**: Use the breakdown view to understand AI recommendations

### Maintenance Tasks
